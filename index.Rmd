## Welcome to My Website

Hello! Iâ€™m Vaiju, a public health researcher with a background in Toxicology and Global Health Epidemiology and Disease Control. My background includes extensive work in public health research, particularly in HIV studies at the Whitman-Walker Institute and mental health outcomes at the Trust for Youth and Child Leadership (TYCL) International. 

I am passionate about using data to drive evidence-based decision-making, improve health outcomes, and advance social justice.
